# Akademos

**PRE-ALPHA VERSION.The package is not complete yet. Expect a working sample in the coming weeks**

*Akademos* is a minimalist theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It makes use of white space and typography to establish visual order. This theme is optimised for writers (and coders) who like the approach of the default Jekyll theme but would like something different.
