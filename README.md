# Akademos: minimalist template for Jekyll

**The package is not complete yet. A production-ready version will be released towards the end of 2016, early 2017.**

*Akademos* is a minimalist theme for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), the static site generator. It makes use of white space and typography to establish visual order. This theme is optimised for writers and coders who like the approach of the default Jekyll theme but would like something different.
